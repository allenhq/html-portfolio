<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Allen Quach, a passionate and driven computer science student with a strong foundation in software development, artificial intelligence, and engineering design. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Chandler-Gilbert Community College and holding an Associate of Science in Computer Science from Mesa Community College, I bring both academic excellence (GPA: 3.96) and hands-on project experience to the table.</p>

<p>Through my coursework and personal initiatives, I’ve developed a solid skill set in front-end and back-end web development, including technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL/NoSQL databases. I’m also experienced in UI/UX design, responsive web layouts, version control with Git, and deploying full-stack applications. Additionally, I have a growing interest in blockchain and Web3, with practical experience in creating NFTs and cryptocurrency tokens.</p>

<p>Beyond software, I have applied engineering skills through projects such as model rocket design and digital circuit implementation. I’ve used tools like SolidWorks, MATLAB, and Logisim to solve real-world problems and bring technical concepts to life. I value collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous learning, and I’m excited about the opportunities at the intersection of AI, software engineering, and innovative technology.

</p>
<p>
  Whether it's building smarter systems, designing efficient algorithms, or crafting user-centric applications, I’m all about using technology to make a positive impact.
